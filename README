RSS User Instruction:

1. You can login with a default account (haoming). If you wish to create a account, click the sign up button.
2. In order to give a ride, you need to follow the following steps:
    a. Creating a car. (please do not delete the car if you have associated it with a trip. However, there is no machnism to stop you doing that yet. But I will implement it in the future)
    b. Creating a route. Check 'create a new route' radio button, and give your route an alias. After this, you can add stop points for the route. (at this stage, SPs cannot be removed from routes.)
    c. Creating a trip.  Check 'create a new trip' radio button, set up alias, direction, trip start and end date, car, and route. Once you select a route, the bottom table will show all SPs related to the selected route. You need select each SP row and set up a time at the right side. After you have assigned arriving times for all SPs, click 'Add' to create a trip. (at the stage, trips cannot be changed or deleted.)
    d. Giving a ride. Click 'add a new ride' and set up alias, and pick a trip and available seats #. The maximum available seats is derived from the trip's car seat number. (at this stage, rides cannot be changed)
3. To book a ride, just click 'Book a ride' in Book Rides view. Firstly, type the desired SP at the right side, click 'search' to find your destination or set off location. When select a SP in the table view, the bottom table will show all rides associated with the selected SP. Simply selecting a ride and clicking 'Book Ride', you can book it and view it from view mode. FYI, bookings can be deleted as it won't mess anything up. (Known bugs: you can even book your own rides = =#)
