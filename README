1. You can login as the default account (haoming). If you wish to create a account, click the sign up button.
2. In order to give a ride, you need to follow the following steps:
    a. Creating a car. (please do not delete the car if you have associated to a trip.
    b. Creating a route. Check 'create a new route' radio button, and give you a route an alias. After this,
        you can add stop points for the route. (at this stage, SPs cannot be removed from routes.)
    c. Creating a trip.  Check 'create a new trip' radio button, set up alias, direction, trip start, end,
        car, and route. Once you select a route, the bottom table will show all SPs related to the selected
        route. You need select each SP and set up a time at the right side. After you have assigned time for
        all SPs, click 'Add' to create a trip. (at the stage, trips cannot be changed or deleted.)
    d. Giving a ride. Click 'add a new ride' and set up alias, and pick a trip and available seats #. The
        maximum available seats is derived from to the trip's car. (at this stage, rides cannot be changed)
3. To book a ride, just click 'Book a ride' in Book Rides view. Firstly, type the desire SP at the right side,
    click 'search' to find your destination or set off location. When select a SP in the table view, the bottom
    table will show all rides associated with the SP. Simply picking a ride and clicking 'Book Ride', you can
    book it and view it from view mode. FYI, bookings can be deleted as it won't mess anything up. (Known bug:
    you can even book your own rides = =#)

Note:
SQLite database is used for this assignment. All controllers are basically just do queries with DB, so I really
don't know how to write unit tests or Cucumber for it. Writing another queries in tests doesn't value much as we
are not to test for database. So for now I only have one test and I know that is bad. Hope I can improve that for
next delivery.
